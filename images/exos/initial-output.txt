Please answer these questions about the security settings you would like to use.
You may quit and accept the default settings by entering 'q' at any time.

!!!!  NOTE: Spanning Tree default changed in ExtremeXOS 22.2  !!!!

Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) is enabled by default to prevent
broadcast storms

Would you like to disable MSTP? [y/N/q]: [   82.893305] Process expy pid 973 died with signal 11

The switch offers an enhanced security mode. Would you like to read more,
and have the choice to enable this enhanced security mode? [y/N/q]: 

Telnet is enabled by default. Telnet is unencrypted and has been the target of 
security exploits in the past.

Would you like to disable Telnet? [y/N/q]: 

SNMP access is disabled by default. SNMPv1/v2c uses no encryption, SNMPv3 can be 
configured to eliminate this problem.

Would you like to enable SNMPv1/v2c? [y/N/q]: 

Would you like to enable SNMPv3? [y/N/q]: 

All ports are enabled by default. In some secure applications, it maybe more 
desirable for the ports to be turned off.

Would you like unconfigured ports to be turned off by default? [y/N/q]: 

No failsafe account username and password are in effect.  If you choose to 
configure them, please remember them because they cannot be recovered. 
Would you like to configure the failsafe username and password now? [y/N/q]: 
Since you have chosen less secure management methods, please remember to 
increase the security of your network by taking the following actions: 

  * change your admin password

* EXOS-VM.1 # enable ssh
