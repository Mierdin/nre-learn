  # Planned stages:
  #
  # 0. Quick overview of snapshots and tests. Basic example that gets you to something useful.
  # 1. Deeper-dive into retrieving data. The various ways you can do this (RPC, CLI) (not everything has a dedicated RPC, but everything in Junos is XML. Also state vs config?
  # 2. Deeper-drive into tests. All of the operators, etc.
  # 3. Using JSNAPy with Python
  # 4. Extra JSNAPy features like sqlite, email, etc? Not sure if this is worth it

  # config, or command-line options?


  # - Snapshots and Tests
  # - Advanced Test Writing
  # - Using JSNAPy from Python
